This html game illustrates the original design of the Spider Stellar Engine, as proposed in:

Vidal, C. 2024. “The Spider Stellar Engine: A Fully Steerable Extraterrestrial Design?” Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 77 (5): 156–66. doi:10.59332/jbis-077-05-0156. https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05038.

Piloting the spider stellar engine is an educational way to understand how the dynamics works.

It was programmed by Gemini 2.5 Pro. 
MIT Licence, feel free to fork & make your own version.

Here are some ideas as a roadmap, by increasing level of difficulty:
- improving and clarifying the scoring system
- create a leaderboard
- make the target star moving
- add moving obstacles
- make a 2-players version, competiting to reach the target star
- add the challenge to capture the target star in a wide orbit. It probably should be so, to avoid 3-body interactions. 
- make the physics more accurate, including the parameters of real spider pulsars (velocity, mass ratio, orbital separation, etc.)
- make a 3D version, adding the challenge to change the orbital plane (by asymmetric evaporation).
- add the management of the intrabinary shock (IBS) that can be wrapped around the millisecond pulsar, or the companion.
